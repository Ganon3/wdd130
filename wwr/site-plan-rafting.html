    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p> To help the world see things out side of bias; 
        into the sperit of engeanring by directing people to books or videos
        they need for the lemmets they have. </p>
    
    <p> We bealive that a lot of problems in this world come because 
        information given to the is made to satisfy bias and non-bias 
        information does not spread to enuph people. </p>
    
    <p> SO here at C3s Engearing of Purception we will provide the education that 
        will alow people to build their own mineds. </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> This sight is mostly made for teachers (since evryone is a teacher in some way this sight is for everyone gernaly).
        This sight will have specific knowledge made into like a librayry and will mostlikely be viewd by adults with
        personal develpoment hopes for being less bias in how they commune. So keep it like a librayer with simple callm and 
        soothing collors. keep in minde that kids may be on so the colors and art stile should be simple for a kid to 
        see and understand but not made for kids. </p>

    <p> other common information - probaly will be accest by phone a lot as the sigth is a libreary like google but just
        not at all big and not at all general. if used in schools then computers but it is like accesing a librayer witch 
        has ben done so follow usful genral structures.
    </p>
